# Dog Breed Identification Project

This project is a **Dog Breed Identification** system that allows users to upload images of dogs, and the model will predict the breed of the dog based on the image. The web application is built using **Flask**, and the model uses **Deep Learning** to classify different dog breeds.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

The project consists of two main components:
1. **Model**: The machine learning model to classify dog breeds.
   - This folder contains the model file (e.g., `model.h5`), dataset, and training scripts.
   
2. **Website**: A Flask-based web application that allows users to upload a dog's image and receive breed predictions.
   - This folder contains the HTML, CSS, and Python scripts for the web app.
